# Basic GitHub project

## A simple palindrome checker in Python

### Usage

* Cloning the repository

First, you need to install Git on your computer. This can be done in many different ways, but here's a link to figure out the best way on your operating system:

Next, open your computer's terminal and run the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/superswan/beginner.git
```
This will download the project onto your system, allowing you to run it later.

You can run a similar command to install any GitHub repository onto your computer, you just need to click the green 'Code' button on the repository page and copy the link, then insert it in front of git clone in the command.

* Installing Python

Firstly, you'll need to determine which version of Python you want to install. For instance, if you want to install Python 3.9, visit the official Python website and navigate to the Downloads section. From there, you can download the appropriate installer for your operating system. Once you have downloaded the installer, run it and follow the prompts to install Python. Depending on your operating system, the process may vary, but it should be straightforward.

* Change directory

Then, run the following command in order to change your terminal's directory into the project directory. This will allow you to run commands that interact with the project files that you downloaded.

```
cd beginner
```

* Executes code

Now, you can run the program using your Python installation and the files you downloaded from GitHub:

```
python palindrome.py
```

Congratulations! You have run your first Python project. Here is an explanation of what a palindrome is, if you didn't know:
